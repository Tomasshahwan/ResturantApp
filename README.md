# ClientEmployeeSystem

Welcome to **ClientEmployeeSystem**! This is my first project as a CS student, built using WinForms and C#. The app features a user-friendly interface for managing client and employee data.

## Features
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy navigation through forms and panels.
- **Data Management**: Add, edit, and view client and employee information.
- **Simple Design**: Utilizes free design resources.

The order menu is the form where you order your food based on minimalistic design and delivery preference, after placing an order, the data is stored in an Order List for the Employees Hub.

## Note
To run the app, you need Visual Studio with WinForms support.
